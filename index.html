            <p>
                Pelé was born Edson Arantes do Nascimento on 23 October 1940 in Três Corações, 
                Minas Gerais, the son of Fluminense footballer Dondinho (born João Ramos do Nascimento) 
                and Celeste Arantes. He was the elder of two siblings, and was named after the American 
                inventor Thomas Edison.His parents decided to remove the "i" and call him "Edson", but 
                there was a typo on his birth certificate, leading many documents to show his name as 
                "Edison", not "Edson", as he was called. He was originally nicknamed "Dico" by his family.

                In 1956, de Brito took Pelé to Santos, an industrial and port city located near São Paulo, 
                to try out for professional club Santos FC, telling the club's directors that the 15-year-old
                 would be "the greatest football player in the world."Pelé impressed Santos coach Lula 
                 during his trial at the Estádio Vila Belmiro, and he signed a professional contract with the
                  club in June 1956. Pelé was highly promoted in the local media as a future superstar. 
                  He made his senior team debut on 7 September 1956 at the age of 15 against Corinthians 
                  de Santo André and had an impressive performance in a 7–1 victory, scoring the first 
                  goal in his prolific career during the match

                Pelé has also been known for connecting the phrase 
                "The Beautiful Game" with football. A prolific goalscorer,
                 he was known for his ability to anticipate opponents in the 
                 area and finish off chances with an accurate and powerful 
                 shot with either foot.Pelé was also a hard-working 
                 team player, and a complete forward, with exceptional vision and
                intelligence, who was recognised for his precise passing and 
                ability to link up with teammates and provide them with assists

                Among the most successful and popular sports figures of the 20th century,
                 Pelé is one of the most lauded players in the history of football and has Beckenbaue
                  frequently ranked the best player ever. Following his emergence
                  at the 1958 World Cup he was nicknamed O Rei ("The King"). Among his contemporaries,
                   Dutch star Johan Cruyff stated, "Pelé was the only footballer who surpassed the boundaries
                    of logic." Brazil's 1970 World Cup-winning captain Carlos Alberto Torres opined: 
                    "His great secret was improvisation. Those things he did were in one moment. He had an
                     extraordinary perception of the game." According to Tostão, his strike partner at
                      the 1970 World Cup: "Pelé was the greatest – he was simply flawless. And off the pitch
                       he is always smiling and upbeat. You never see him bad-tempered. He loves being Pelé
                       . His Brazilian teammate Clodoaldo commented on the adulation he witnessed:
                        "In some countries they wanted to touch him, in some they wanted to kiss him. In
                         others they even kissed the ground he walked on. I thought it was beautiful, 
                         just beautiful." According to Franz Beckenbauer, West Germany's 1974 
                         World Cup-winning captain: "Pelé is the greatest player of all time.
                          He reigned supreme for 20 years. There's no one to compare with him."
